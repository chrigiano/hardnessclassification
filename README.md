# hardnessclassification
5-class hardness classification by a tactile sensing system mounted on a Baxter robot. 

The Dataset folder contains the cube and cylinder data divided per class for 40 and 80 samples extracted from the grasp peaks. For each kind of objects we collected five classes, i.e. five hardness levels, having 170 data each. The classes 0, 1, and 2 of the cylinders correspond to the classes 0,1, and 2 of the cubes, respectively.
